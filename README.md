# 22_23-J 17

Main Objective: 
    To implement a mobile application for identifying the Blister Blight disease at early stages and
    recognizing the progression-level of the disease. This is followed by the prediction of the 
    dispersion and classification of nutrient deficiencies at the beginning.


(Sub Objective 1: Tea Leaf Identification and Tea Disease Classification.)

    • Classify the tea leaf from other objects.
    • Blister Blight Tea Disease Classification.

(Sub Objective 2: Identifying the Progression Levels of Blister Blight.)

    • Identifying the severity symptoms of Blister Blight.
    • Calculating the progression level of Blister Blight.
   
(Sub Objective 3: Disease Dispersion and Blister Blight Season Forecasting.)

    • Calculate nearby fields’ dispersion possibility.
    • Identify the Blister Blight dispersion patterns of nearby fields.
    • Predict the Blister Blight emergence date.

(Sub Objective 4: Differentiating Tea cultivars and Nutrient Deficiencies in Tea Leaves.)

    • Identification of Tea cultivar in tea leaves.
    • Identification of nutrient deficiency in tea leaves.
    • Crowd-sourcing Platform for Information Sharing.
